== Description ==

Catalog mode, often referred to as "Browse-only mode" or "Showroom mode," is a functionality within an e-commerce website 
or online store that allows customers to view and explore product listings without the ability to make direct purchases. 
In this mode, the website operates as a digital catalog, showcasing products, their descriptions, images, and prices, but 
without enabling the immediate addition of items to a shopping cart or the completion of transactions.

== Installation ==

2. Search for "Catalog Mode".
3. Click install.
4. Click activate.
5. Once the plugin is installed then you can see RestroPress on the left navigation bar of WordPress Dashboard.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
